Basic bread recipe. CMM 03/22/2017
This recipe makes a big crusty bread, or many small ones.

Ingredients:
4 cups of flour (wheat, white, all-purpose)
12 oz. water (give of take a few oz.)
a little sugar (1-3 tablespoons)
a little fat (oil, butter, etc.,  1-3 tablespoons)
a little salt (1-3 teaspoons)
a little yeast (1-3 teaspoons)

Process:
1.  In large mixing bowl, put a couple of oz. of the water (lukewarm or room temperature, definitely not hot).  Mix in the sugar and yeast.  Wait until it becomes bubbly, maybe 15 minutes or so depending on room temperature.
2.  Add almost all the flour to the yeast mixture and sprinkle the salt over the flour.
3.  Add the fat and most of the water.  Mix until the water is absorbed and a dough ball is formed.  If the dough is too dry to add a tiny sprinkle of water and continue mixing until a dough ball is formed.  Do this as necessary.
4.  Dust the dough ball with flour to coat it and prevent it from sticking to the sides of the bowl.  You can also use a little bit of cooking oil to coat the dough ball.  Cover the bowl and set aside in a warm place.  The dough ball will double in volume in a couple of hours.
5.  After the dough ball has double in size, punch it down and shape the dough into the bread shape that you want.  You can also split into several smaller loaves.  Place the unbaked loaves on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper.  Cut slits on top of your loaves.  Place in a warm place to rise, covered with a towel if necessary.  Wait about an hour.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  When the oven is hot, carefully place the baking sheet in the oven.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake for another 20-30 minutes.  The loaves are done when they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped.  Set the loaves to cool for about 10 minutes before enjoying.
